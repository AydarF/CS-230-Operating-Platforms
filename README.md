CS-230-H7391 Operating Platforms 22EW2 8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission

  <strong>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</strong><br />
  Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) found a new client not long ago - The Gaming Room is. The Gaming Room is looking for a company to develop a web-based game for them that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is only available in an Android application now.
  
  <strong>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</strong><br />
  In developing this documentation, I composed a thorough evaluation and recommendation parts that cover the most important sections such as development requirements, operating platforms, operating systems architectures, storage and memory management, distributed systems and networks, and security.
  
  <strong>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</strong><br />
  When working on the project, I found breaking down and evaluating the UML diagram to be one of the most useful processes to understand the connection of the app components.
  
  <strong>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</strong><br />
  I would pick evaluation because it allowed me to delve into the details of comparing the minute details of the platforms, as well as their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. I would improve by evaluating browsers in more detail to determine which ones should be adopted and which ones should be avoided.
  
  <strong>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</strong><br />
  User needs include such components as duties the users should finish, the way the users should finish them, and pain points hindering users from accomplishing the duties. It’s crucial to meet user needs because users are the product consumers, and the user demand will decide if the product is profitable or if it’s going to flop.
  
  <strong>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</strong><br />
  Some of the ways I approached creating the software is I paid close attention to documentation, separating the software into separate blocks, testing, and maintaining the code.
